Test Description:

Measure the time taken and the throughput for the execution of move operation in zookeeper.

The Move operation is defined as:

1. Measure Start time.
2. Create Destination node. zk.create()
3. Read Data from Source node to a String Variable. zk.get()
4. Set the data read to the Destination Node. zk.set()
5. Delete the Source node. zk.delete()
6. Measure the end time and time difference.
7. Repeat Step 1 to 6 for different number of Nodes and measure the execution time and throughput.

Also the above the test is repeated for the different configurations. The change in configurations are as follows:

1. Logs on Disk.
2. Logs on Ramdisk.
