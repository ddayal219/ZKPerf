Test: Obtain a lower bound on Time and Upper Bound on Speed of On-Disk Zookeeper throughput.

Collect performance data to measure the throughput for writing to disk, for various sizes of N and B, via the following algorithm:

1. Open a file of size N*B for writing.
2. for i = 0 to N-1
Write B bytes at position i*B to the file.
3. Close the file.

Time step 2 only.
