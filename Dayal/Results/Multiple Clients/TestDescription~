Test Name:

ZK Performance Test - Multiple Clients

Test Description:

The purpose of the test is to check the performance of zookeeper with the requests from multiple clients.

Mulitple clients are simulated by using multiple java threads requesting to zookeeper parallely.

In this way the request load on zookeeper is increased and the performance is measured.

Also, each Request made by each client is run in Asynchronous mode and the performance throughput is measured.
