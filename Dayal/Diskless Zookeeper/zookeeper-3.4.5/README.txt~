Zookeeper - 3.4.5 Diskless version:

Zookeeper Diskless version is a high performance version of Zookeeper-3.4.5. In this version, we removed the Disk dependency of zookeeper by removing the Transaction Logging Mechanism. We use the 
fuzzy snapshots along with ZAB replication to provide durability during worse failure condtions(when more n servers fail out of 2n+1 operating servers). By using this method we can achieve very write performance in Zookeeper. The Write performance in this mode is approximately 30x times faster in magnitude than Default Zookeeper.

Use the JAR file in /build/zookeeper-3.4.5.jar to start using Diskless Zookeeper.

Major Modifications:

1. There is no Transaction logging.

2. One Snapshots are taken. Snapshots are taking depending upon Fuzzy snapcount, see link 6 below.

3. See link 5 for Restoration Guarantee of Diskless Zookeeper.
